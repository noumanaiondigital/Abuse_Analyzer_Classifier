# Abuse_Analyzer_Classifier

### Problem Statement
Using the Abuse Analyzer Dataset, in this project, we will try and develop few machine learning algorithms for
text classification. <br>
##### Task involved in this project are:
1. Choose and implement a text representation technique (such as a bag of words, word
embeddings etc.). 
2. Using the text representation from (1), build a machine learning model for text classification
(e.g. decision tree, neural network etc.).
3. Evaluate the model perfromance using the appropriate metrics of our choice.
